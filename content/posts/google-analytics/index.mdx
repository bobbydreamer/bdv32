Analytics, todays world is driven by it. People want to see graphs, beautiful dashboard, trendlines and from the look of it last decade is totally dedicated to evolution of Warehousing in IT, it went from Normal Data Warehousing to Data Lakes. Sort of looks like, purposefully all these Cloud providers and these startup developers, dumped their log data in their own format which only they can understand and they call it unstructured as there is no standard. Processing these logs itself is a business for many. 

Todays topic deals with the first part, sleepless nights and whats the purpose in life. Little analytics to know, is my website "Still a Ninja". I am expecting count of users to be 1(thats me). 

[Quote from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics)
> Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. It also entails applying data patterns towards effective decision making. In other words, analytics can be understood as the connection between data and effective decision making within an organization.
