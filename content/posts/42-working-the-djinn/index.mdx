> an intelligent spirit of lower rank than the angels, able to appear in human and animal forms and to possess humans. 

Mind is completely a different animal, it talks to us and sometimes we talk back to it. Its capable of giving ideas and suggestions, sometimes they are great and other times they could be lame. Here, i am calling the mind as DJinn, it needs to be equipped with right motivation, attitude and mindset to handle all the things that come at it and i have to make it my best ally. 

All the below notes are taken while reading books, hearing audio books and youtube videos. Some of which motivate and inspire me. 

The first quote/motto that really motivates me is the below one. This is my [school motto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_Anglo-Indian_Higher_Secondary_School). I didn't understand this, when i was studying but used to read this everyday in School assembly and its in my school badge. Thing is, its pops in my head, whenever i work or start something like a project. I have come to a stage, i cannot do anything less than best, i put my full and all my effort in the work. 

> Do you best

Those three little words.

> Discipline yourself to focus on what you know is good for you. You have a list of habits already that you probably follow — like exercise, reading, leisure time, meditation — and you can focus your time there and get far better returns than the endless porn-fuelled addictions of meaningless nonsense. -Tim Denning

Remember Theodore Roosevelt’s famous ‘The Man in the Arena’ talk wherein he said – 
> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Mark Twain is quoted as saying – 
> Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.

> Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.
