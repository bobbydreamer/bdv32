**Note-to-self : See it again - There are many points**

**Most important things**    

* The most important thing in investing is controlling risk. 
* The most important thing is buy at low price. 
* The most important thing is act as a contrarian

* *Memos are available in Oaktree Capital website for free - Download it*. 

* Personal philosophy comes from what you have taught by parents and teachers and your experiences. Experiences tell you what have been taught and have to be modified. 

* It is either, the most important badly written book or worst written very important book you will ever read. 

* **Book** : Decision making under uncertainty by C.Jackson Greyson

> In the world when there is randomness at work. You can't tell from outcome that decision good or bad. 
> In real world good decisions, fail to work all the time and bad decisions work all the time. 

* You should not act as if the things that should happen are the things that will happen. 
* If expected value is outcome. Don't think about single outcome, you think in terms of range of outcomes
* Should is not equal to will.  Lots of things that should happen fail to happen. Even if they fail to happen they fail to happen on schedule. 

* We cannot live on averages. 
* Investors should be good enough to go for winners. 

**Bonds**    

* AAA bonds are bonds that everybody think they are great. Companies are making lot of money, outlook is good, they have prudent balance sheets and everything is perfect. If everything is perfect it can't get better, if it cant get better than it can only get worse and there is only one way to go, DOWN. 
* Single B bond, I'd they survive, there is only one way to go for them, UP. On the other side, they can default and file bankruptcy. 

* Bond investing a negative art 

**How bond works**    

you know how bonds work, a bond is a promise to pay. You give me $100, and I promise to give you 5% interest every year, and then give your money back in 20 years. So, it does not make sense to pick and choose a bond, you can blindly pick a bond that pays and that will pay. Only thing that matters is exclude the one that doesn't pay. 

* The greatness of your performance comes not from what you buy but from what you exclude. 

**Oaktree's Investment Philosopy**    

1. The primacy of risk control
  - For excellence in investing, the most important thing is not making lot of money, is not beating the market, its not being in top quartile, the most important thing is controling risk. 
2. Emphasis on consistency
  - We don't try for the moon with the danger for crashing. I want to be above the middle on a consistent basis over the long term. 
3. The importance of market inefficiency
4. The benefits of specialization
5. Macro-forecasting not critical to investing
  - Its OKAY to have an opinion but you just shouldn't act as if it's right. 
6. Disavowal of market timing
  - We don't do market timing. We do long term investing on assets which are under priced. 

> Oaktree motto
> If we avoid the losers, the winners take care of themselves. 

* First the innovator, then the imitators, then the idiot

* Secret to happiness comes from prudence and caution. Its doesn't come from stroke of genius on the easy streak
