* Learning to contently live with less has the same effect as growing your income

* Money is often a negative art. 
  - It has a lot to do with the actions you don’t take and things you avoid.

* Everything has a price, and prices aren’t always clear. 
  - The price of exercise(fitness) isn’t just the workout; it’s avoiding the post-workout appetite. Same in finance. The price of building wealth isn’t just the trouble of earning money; it’s avoiding the post-earnings urge to spend what you’ve accumulated.

* The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investment here or missed financial goal there won't wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.
