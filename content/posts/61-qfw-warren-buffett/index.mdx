  1. If you were to closely follow a company, you shouldn't own it. If you buy a farm, do you go and look every couple of weeks and see how far the corn is up and you know you worry too much about whether somebody says this is a year of low prices and exports are being affected. You buy a farm and you hold it, i bought 1 farm, my son runs it but i have been there only once. It doesn't grow faster, if i go and stare at it and i can't cheer for it. 
  1. On buyback: We buy BRK shares when we have lots of excess cash and all needs of business are taken care. First would love to find other business to buy but if our stock is selling below intrinsic value, we buy our stock.
